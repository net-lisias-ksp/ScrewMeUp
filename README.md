*Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate*

**Screw Me Up** intentionally tries to Screw Up Unity's `Monobehaviour`s and KSP's `PartModule`'s live cycles.

**Screw Me Up /L** is Lisias' management screwing you up - intentionally, this time!

**ATTENTION**!! This thing **intentionally** tries to screw things up on KSP in order to map where the game can go south when uncaught exceptions are thrown on some key points of Unity's and KSP's life cycle.

**This thing is intentionally harmful** to your savegames, and **should not** be used by end users, but for developers in need to understand how things go south on KSP.

## Description

`ScrewMeUp` injects two `PartModule`s into our old friend `strutCube` (see this [issue](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/issues/288) for the whole story, and this Forum's [post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/205063-ksp-131-distant-object-enhancement-doe-l-under-new-management-21111r2-2023-0116/&do=findComment&comment=4231609) for the reasoning).

With this piece of crap installed, you will be able to inject `NullReferenceExceptions` into Unity's and/or KSP's Life Cycle, and study the effects on the game.

Be warned: you will be **Royally Screwed** on some key points of the game. **DO NOT** use this on any valuable savegame, you had been warned.
